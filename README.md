# Raylib Test Game
Simple game I am making to try out Raylib.
You play as a rocketship that constantly spins. Whenever you press space, the rocket accelerates to move forward. When the key is released, it decelerates and continues spinning. There is inertia which makes it challenging to move.

Eventually I plan on releasing it as a mobile game.
